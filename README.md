# MakerSquare Prework

This repository is for various projects in my MakerSquare prework.  Completed Jan-July 2014

### Ruby Projects

1. RubyCipher -- Technically not a MakerSquare project.  I developed this based on this [tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/encryptor.html).

2. Choose Your Own Adventure game -- I actually wrote this during a MakerSquare Ruby Noobies meetup.

3.  Fizzbuzz

4. Cookbook -- This includes some basic Sinatra.

5. Cars

6. Power Rangers

7. Banking -- Includes some RSpec testing.

8. Web Guesser -- Basic number-guessing app using Sinatra. Based on this [tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html).

### HTML & CSS Projects

1. Hipster Thesis - Early HTML & CSS prework.  Included Google fonts.

2.  pH Scale - Used a color picker to grab color hex codes from the sample item and adjusted background colors to make the scale work.

### JavaScript Projects

1. JavaScript Basics -- a number of simple exercises from MKS prework

2. Guess The Number - a simple game of guessing a random number using user prompts

3. Lockbox - basic jQuery

### Frameworks

1.  A mockup using Foundation and Font-Awesome.  Here is the [original image](http://s17.postimg.org/j9x0igbjz/eterna.jpg).
