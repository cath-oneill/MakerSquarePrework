# MakerSquare Prework

This repository is for various projects in my MakerSquare prework.  Completed Jan-July 2014

### Ruby Projects

1. RubyCipher -- Technically not a MakerSquare project.  I developed this based on this [tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/encryptor.html).

2. Choose Your Own Adventure game -- I actually wrote this during a MakerSquare Ruby Noobies meetup.

3.  Fizzbuzz

4. Cookbook

### HTML & CSS Projects

1. Hipster Thesis - Early HTML & CSS prework.  Included Google fonts.

2.  pH Scale - Used a color picker to grab color hex codes from the sample item and adjusted background colors to make the scale work.
